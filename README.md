Vietnam’s Balance of Payments (BoP) in 2020 - Macro Economics

International economic integration has become a significant trend, expanding deeply in scale and scope across various fields. In this context, Vietnam has been engaging in international economic integration for a long time, starting with the comprehensive reform of the country in 1986. Notably, in 2007, Vietnam officially became the 150th member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), marking an important milestone in the country's industrialization and modernization efforts. This event signified a deeper integration of Vietnam into the international market, particularly in the banking and finance sector.

To seize opportunities and proactively address challenges during the integration process, Vietnam has been striving to improve its international balance. However, accurately and promptly maintaining a complete balance of payments account is challenging due to the extensive scope of data collection required. For the balance of payments to serve as an effective tool for analyzing and managing foreign economic activities, it is crucial to conduct thorough research in both theory and practice regarding the establishment, analysis, and adjustment of the international balance of payments.

Therefore, I have chosen the topic: “Vietnam’s Balance of Payments.” Through this study, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of this issue, which will provide a clearer perspective on Vietnam's balance of payments. I look forward to receiving your feedback. Thank you sincerely.
